# Getting started

## Installation

Please check the official laravel installation guide for server requirements before you start [Laravel 8 Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x). Necessary settings before starting as PHP >= 7.3, NodeJS, Composer

Alternative installation is possible without local dependencies relying on [Docker](#docker). 

1. Clone the repository

        git clone https://github.com/VMDang/LibraryManage.git

2. Switch to the repo folder

        cd LibraryManage

3. Install all the dependencies using composer and npm

        composer install
        npm install

4. Copy the example env file and make the required configuration changes in the .env file

        cp .env.example .env
> Please contact me via [Mail](mailto:dang.vm205063@sis.hust.edu.vn) to know more about the content in the .env file
5. Generate a new application key

        php artisan key:generate

6. Run the database migrations (**Set the database connection in .env before migrating**)

        php artisan migrate

7. Run database seeders
   
        php artisan db:seed     
8. Start the local development server

        php artisan serve

You can now access the server at http://localhost:8000

## Database seeding

**Populate the database with seed data with relationships which includes users, roles, permission, books, category,... This can help you to quickly start testing the api or couple a frontend and start using it with ready content.**

Run the database seeder and you're done

    php artisan db:seed

***Note*** : It's recommended to have a clean database before seeding. You can refresh your migrations at any point to clean the database by running the following command

    php artisan migrate:refresh

>

```
git clone https://github.com/VMDang/LibraryManage.git
